<h1>Introduce</h1>
<p>Weight Round Robin.</p>
<p>WRR applies one weight ([1, inf]) to every schedule node.
And except an output schedule chance meets the configured
weights.</p>
<p>The basic principle is.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Set a weight count (wgt) for every node to record 
  current node selection time. Initialize the count by weight value.</li>
  <li>Decrease wgt with 1 when scheduler selecting corresponding node.</li>
  <li>Stop selecting corresponding node when wgt is small than zero.</li>
  <li>Reload all wgts with corresponding weight when none node can be selecting</li>
</ul>

<h1>DWRR</h1>
<p>WRR with deficit.</p>
<p>WRR implements a weighted distribution based as scheduling chance.
DWRR extends this weighted distribution to any custom unit. DWRR decrease a weighted 
unit which user custom instead of 1 when selects a node.</p>
<p>DWRR needs an explicit weighted distribution unit. Default is byte.</p>
